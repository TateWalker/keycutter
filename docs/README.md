- [Keycutter Config Directory](docs/keycutter-config-dir/README.md) 
- [Defense layers to protect against key misuse](docs/defense-layers-to-protect-against-key-misuse.md)
- [Why FIDO SSH Keys are good for Git access on managed devices](docs/why-fido-ssh-keys-are-good-for-git-access-on-managed-devices.md)
- [Design goals of the project](docs/design-goals.md)
- Side benefits
    - Doesn't announce your github keys to other services
