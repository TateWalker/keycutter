# Keycutter Configuration Directory

The Keycutter configuration directory, located at `~/.keycutter` by default, is the central repository for all configuration files and keys managed by the Keycutter tool. This directory contains configurations for git and SSH, along with a general config file, facilitating a modular and organised approach to managing access and identity across different services and platforms.

## Example Config Generated by Keycutter

The Keycutter configuration directory consists of the following components:

This structure is designed to make the management of multiple identities and access configurations as straightforward as possible, reducing the overhead and complexity typically associated with handling various configurations across multiple services.

```
$ tree ~/.keycutter
/home/m/.keycutter
├── git
│   ├── allowed_signers                  # Verify commits signed with SSH Keys
│   ├── conf.d
│   │   └── github-alexdoe-work          # Git config associated with this key
│   └── gitconfig-keycutter              # Conditionally includes config.d files
└── ssh                     
    ├── config.d
    │   └── github-alexdoe-work          # SSH configuration for key
    └── keys                             
        ├── yk01@github-alexdoe-work     # SSH private key
        └── yk01@github-alexdoe-work.pub # SSH Publivc Key
```
