# Keycutter SSH Config - https://github.com/bash-my-aws/keycutter/config

# SSH Config for improved SSH Key security supporting:
#
# - SSH Keytags naming convention: e.g. github.com_mbailey@work
# - SSH Key Privacy: Define which keys to offer to remote hosts.
# - SSH Agent Profiles: Define which keys to forward to different remote hosts.
# - SSH over SSM: Automatically copy public SSH key to AWS EC2 remote hosts.
# - Support for multiple service accounts (e.g. GitHub.com)
#
# Add the following to your shell profile to set required variable:
#
#    # keycutter uses this to determine which SSH key to use
#    [[ -z $SSH_CONNECTION ]] && export KEYCUTTER_ORIGIN="$(hostname -s)"

# Load custom rules for hosts (that override or append to directives below).
Include keycutter/hosts/*

# ORIGIN/NON-ORIGIN: Set $KEYCUTTER_ORIGIN on remote host and start $SHELL
Match final exec "bash -c '[[ $(ps -o args= -p $PPID) =~ ^ssh[[:space:]]+((-[^T ]+[[:space:]]+)*[^-][^ ]*)?$ ]]'"

  # Using SendEnv enables KEYCUTTER_ORIGIN to be:
  #
  #   - a custom name, instead of $(hostname -s)
  #   - forwarded more than one hop, enabling multihop ssh-agent forwarding
  #
  # Note:
  #
  #   - Ignored unless remote sshd configured to AcceptEnv KEYCUTTER_ORIGIN.
  #   - AcceptEnv has potential implications for security.
  #   - ProxyJump is usually a better alternative to ssh agent forwarding.
