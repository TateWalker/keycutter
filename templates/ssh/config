# Keycutter SSH Config
#
# https://github.com/bash-my-aws/keycutter
#
# Zeroconf SSH Key selection supporting:
#
# - FIDO SSH Keys:
#   - Unstealable* SSH Keys on hardware security keys
#   - User presence confirmation
# - SSH Keytags: Convention to simplify use of multiple ssh keys.
# - ssh-agent forwarding: Remote hosts request correct key.
# - Multiple ssh-agents: Enforce security boundaries
# - SSH over SSM (AWS): Automatically copy public key to remote hosts
#
# Source from ~/.ssh/config with: Include ~/.keycutter/ssh/config
# ...or replace it by setting shell env var: SSH_CONFIG=~/.keycutter/ssh/config

# Required shell Environment Variables
#
# KEYCUTTER_DEVICE: hostname of local host 
# KEYCUTTER_ORIGIN: hostname of host with hardware security key
#
# Add the following to your shell profile to set these variables:
#
#    # keycutter needs these to determine which SSH key to use
#    export KEYCUTTER_DEVICE="$(hostname -s)"
#    [[ -z "${SSH_CONNECTION}" ]] && export KEYCUTTER_ORIGIN="${KEYCUTTER_DEVICE}"
